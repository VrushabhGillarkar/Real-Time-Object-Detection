# 🧠 Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 + Flask + OpenCV

A real-time object detection web application using the YOLOv8n model (`yolov8n.pt`), integrated with Flask and OpenCV. The system captures video from a webcam, processes frames using a lightweight deep learning model, and displays live detection results in a browser.
