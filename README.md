# 🧠 Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 + Flask + OpenCV

A real-time object detection web application using the YOLOv8n model (`yolov8n.pt`), integrated with Flask and OpenCV. The system captures video from a webcam, processes frames using a lightweight deep learning model, and displays live detection results in a browser.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-object-detection.git
cd real-time-object-detection
```
2. **Install dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Download YOLOv8n model**

The ultralytics package will automatically download yolov8n.pt on the first run.

You can also manually download it from the Ultralytics Model Zoo.

##  ▶️ How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
```
python app.py
```
Then open your browser and go to:

📍 http://localhost:5000/

You’ll see live video with real-time object detection.
